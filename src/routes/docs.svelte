  <b>Cranker's Courier</b>
  - In the mid 1980s a young man, while still in high school, began sending out
  a newsletter to various talk hosts. He was one of the most prolific crank
  callers in the Miami market, and managed to befriend some of the board ops. He
  was able to get inside information about the talk stations. Neil dubbed him
  Fruit Cake, and the moniker stuck.

<h3>Support</h3>
<p>
  There are several ways you can support the Neil Rogers Audio Restoration
  Project.
</p>

<h4>#1 Donate Audio</h4>
<p>
  Do you have any audio of the Neil Rogers Show or other South Florida talk
  radio shows that you would like to share? Check our archives to see if we have
  a show from that date. If the show is before 1999 and it already exists in our
  archive, we may still able to use your audio. Most of the shows before 1999
  are partial. Some are good quality and some aren’t. We can date the show and
  add to the archive.
</p>
<p>
  Ideally, your audio should be in digital format. Since John Baker passed away,
  we are no longer set up to convert tapes to digital.
</p>

<p>
  Email
  <b>audio@neilrogers.org.</b>
  Thank you!
</p>

<h4>#2 Listen and Write Show Notes</h4>
<p>
  Our goal is to not only collect as much audio as possible but to index all the
  shows and make the topics searchable. Many of the shows from 2001-2009 do not
  have notes. Our goal is to have notes for every recovered show. This will make
  it easier for Neil fans to find the shows they are looking for.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Go to YouTube and find a show without notes or peek at our shared
    <a
      href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1czK9DiOqCK_P8lYS5Im8a_u9IZnKW39lBAuq3FXdmRM/edit?usp=sharing">
      Google Drive Spreadsheet.
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>Listen to show and take notes.</li>
  <li>
    Post the show notes either as a comment on the video or email them to
    audio@neilrogers.org.
  </li>
  <li>
    Those notes will either be pinned (as top comment) and/or added to the show
    description.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>#3 Share and Like</h4>
<p>
  Spread the word to others about Uncle Neil by sharing links to everything we
  have saved. Give a like to the shows. The more fans that discover Neil is
  alive and well in the archives, the more likely we will find the fans that
  have more audio to add to our collection.
</p>

<h4>#4 Do You Know Someone That Works For Yahoo!?</h4>
<p>
  In 1999 Yahoo! acquired Broadcast.com, which archived the Neil Rogers Show in
  the early days. We need many of the shows from December 30, 1997, to January
  19, 1999. They will be in Real Audio format. Below is a list of URLs that
  might be clues as to what servers or backup archives these audio files might
  be found.{' '}
  <b>Please help us recover these shows!</b>
</p>

<ul style={{ listStyleType: 'none', wordBreak: 'break-all' }}>
  <li>www.broadcast.com/radio/archives/wqam/rogers/</li>
  <li>www.yahoo.com/radio/archives/wqam/rogers/</li>
  <li>radio.yahoo.com//archives/wqam/rogers/</li>
  <li>launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/archives/wqam/rogers/</li>
  <li>new.music.yahoo.com/launchcast/archives/wqam/rogers/</li>
  <li>music.yahoo.com/launchcast/archives/wqam/rogers/</li>
  <li>playlist.broadcast.com</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Yahoo! will also have shows from 2000 to May 2002, which we need for our
  archives. I am absolutely convinced these shows exist somewhere on a Yahoo!
  server that the public does not have access to.
