<h3>Childhood</h3>

  Neil’s first radio job was while he was still in high school. At age 17 he
  played music on WCGR in Canandaigua, NY. Then he attended college for two
  years at Michigan State where he studied broadcasting. After Michigan State,
  Neil returned to New York in 1963 where he worked for WBTA 1490 in Batavia,

<h3>Sarasota, FL (1973)</h3>

<p>
  According to the Miami Herald, Neil began his talk radio career at WSPB 1450
  in Sarasota, FL.
</p>

<blockquote>
  In 1973, Rogers moved to Sarasota, where quite by accident he did his first
  talk radio show. The station hired a retiree from Pittsburgh to do a talk
  show, but on his first day, the fellow couldn’t figure out to work the phone
  and his guest didn’t show up. The second day, the retiree’s blood pressure
  soared and his nose bled. Rogers, who was spinning records at the station,
  came to the rescue.
